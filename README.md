Divided we fall is a revamp of a previous hackathon project made at Rose Hack in the very beginning of 2023.

## Overview
Divided We Fall's current state is a web application available for public use. With our project you can input a link to article, site, blog post, etc. As long as it is pubically viewable you can input an url, request an analysis, and recieve a score. This score will tell you potentially how bias the content of the link is. The bias report has no politically views or opinions it is an unbiased model that is trained and language data.

## Why did we build it?
Our team believes the current political state of the world is in shambles. The state of modern media has created immense political division. Today's 24/7 news channels and personalized social media streams not only affirm but also amplify our existing beliefs, deepening divisions and fostering bitterness toward differing viewpoints. We feel that having an unbiased model capable of showing you the potential bias in the media you consume is extremely important.

## How to use
Using our project is quite simple! Find a link, click, and view the bias scores!
